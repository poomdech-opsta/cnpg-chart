# One chart to rule them all

This repository is a fork of the [Gimlet OneChart project](https://github.com/gimlet-io/onechart).

A generic Helm chart for your application deployments.

Because no-one can remember the Kubernetes yaml syntax.

https://github.com/opsta/onechart/blob/main/docs/onechart.md

## Getting started

OneChart is a generic Helm Chart for web applications. The idea is that most Kubernetes manifest look alike, only very few parts actually change.

You can also template and install onechart from an OCI repository as follows:

> **Note:** The examples use version `0.78.0`. This will be the unreleased version if you are at the `main` branch.

> You can find the latest released version in the [releases](https://github.com/opsta/onechart/releases) page.

Check the generated Kubernetes yaml:

```bash
helm template my-release oci://ghcr.io/opsta/onechart --version 0.78.0 \
  --set image.repository=nginx \
  --set image.tag=1.19.3
```

Deploy with Helm:

```bash
helm install my-release oci://ghcr.io/opsta/onechart --version 0.78.0 \
  --set image.repository=nginx \
  --set image.tag=1.19.3
```

The example below deploys your application image, sets environment variables and configures the Kubernetes Ingress domain name:

```bash
helm template my-release oci://ghcr.io/opsta/onechart --version 0.78.0 -f values.yaml

# values.yaml
image:
  repository: my-app
  tag: fd803fc
vars:
  VAR_1: "value 1"
  VAR_2: "value 2"
ingress:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  host: my-app.mycompany.com
```

## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OneChart project.

Below are some guidelines and best practices for contributing to this repository:

### Issues

If you are running a fork of OneChart and would like to upstream a feature, please open a pull request for it.

### New Features

If you are planning to add a new feature to OneChart, please open an issue for it first. Helm charts are prone to having too many features, and OneChart want to keep the supported use-cases in-check. Proposed features have to be generally applicable, targeting newcomers to the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### Pull Request Process

* Fork the repository.
* Create a new branch and make your changes.
* Open a pull request with detailed commit message and reference issue number if applicable.
* A maintainer will review your pull request, and help you throughout the process.

## Development

Development of OneChart does not differ from developing a regular Helm chart.

The source for OneChart is under `charts/onechart` where you can locate the `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` and the templates.

We write unit tests for our helm charts. Pull requests are only accepted with proper test coverage.

The tests are located under `charts/onechart/test` and use the https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest Helm plugin to run the tests.

For installation, refer to the CI workflow at `.github/workflows/build.yaml`.

## Release process

* Create a new tag with the format `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
* Github Actions will be triggered and test, lint, package the Helm chart and push to the OCI repository.
